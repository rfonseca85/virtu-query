# Welcome to Virtu.query! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Virtu.query is an innovative project by **Virtu.ai** that revolutionizes database interactions by allowing users to query databases using natural human language and provides human-readable answers. This simplifies the querying process and makes data more accessible.

## Features

- Natural Language Processing: Query databases using simple human language.
- Human-Readable Responses: Receive answers in an easy-to-understand format.
- Docker Support: Simplified setup and deployment using Docker.
- PostgreSQL Integration: Ready-to-use with a PostgreSQL database for testing. (Easy to implement with other databases as well)

## How to use

Get started simply asking anything you want to know about the database. 
For example, you can ask:
 - "What is the name of the first customer?"
 - "Which customers spent more money in furniture?"
 - "How many customers are there in the database?"
 - "What is the total sales of the store?"
 - "What is the average sales of the store?"

Possibilities are endless! Virtu.query will understand your question and provide you with a human-readable answer.
